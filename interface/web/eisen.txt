- List of input devices, which can be checked on or off

- List of output devices, with start and stop buttons. Once a start button is clicked, all buttons except the stop button must be deactivated.

- Box / list of error messages

- Some way of representing the units. Also one must be able to see and change the parameters / dependencies of the units

- Visualize dependence of units to each other

- Loading .synth files (and maybe also an export function of the current state)

- Should be able to add and remove units
